## Fantasy football data

Run with `run.sh` to download and parse data

## TODO

- [ ] download current rosters
- [ ] download schedules
- [ ] add seed data (nfl team schedules, handcuffs, notable injuries)

## analysis ideas

* Top waiver targets
    * who else needs them based on byes
    * who doesn't need them based on depth
    * look at remaining FAAB and other bids to get an idea of price
* look at upcoming matchups and byes
* handcuffs
